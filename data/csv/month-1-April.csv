,"From 04/08
to 04/17",,"LOTS of story and tutorials during this period.
There's not much to talk about during this time but there's a few small things you could do

- The answer to the first class question is Villians (Knowledge +1.)
- 04/12 and 04/15 can be used to grind a little for some extra resources before the game takes the training wheels off. Grinding this early is a bit unnecessary but could be helpful if you need 
a little extra help to clear the first Palace in one Day.
- 04/12, Proceed until the firearms tutorial, then head back to the jail cells. Using that door you can respawn the shadows and farm until you're out of resources or near death. 
Feel free to save as you farm. Triggering the all-out attack tutorial will prevent shadow respawns but will restore your HP and SP (not that you'll need it at this point.)
- 04/15 Similar to 04/12 you can farm shadows in the room after the Negotiation Tutorial. Don't approach the safe room, this will disable shadow respawns so save at the Entrance.
Farm for more EXP, use Hold Up for some extra cash, and recruit a few shadows to the team. If you've farmed to exhaustion on 04/12 & 04/15 expect to be lv 6 with 20,000 Yen to play with.
- Prep early, you're likely going yo get them anyway but make sure you have Jack-o'-Lantern, Pixie, and Bicorn and level Bicorn to Lv6. You'll need them for Fusions later.
- Having a Jack-o'-Lantern will help for the mini-boss so save around 20 SP for yourself and 16 SP for Morgana. The boss is weak to Fire skills (Agi.) First turn have Joker cast Rakunda on the 
Boss then have your new friend attack with Agi to trigger an All-Out Attack. Skull is weak to the bosses wind (Garu) attack so have him guard to keep things easy.
- 04/15 Is the earliest you can access any bonus DLC Items and the P5 save file Bonuses
- 04/17 Save before cleaning your desk off and see if you make an extra lockpick. It's not likely to happen but if you get it, enjoy the two lockpicks and extra point in Proficiency. ",,,,,,,
